# 3D printers at bitraf

## There are 10 3D printers
Most of these doesn't work at the moment. Plants to upgrade and fix seems limited. This means there might be ample opportunity to get stuff done using only initiative. However, this increases the amount of work significantly. 

The 10 printers are:
- 3 Ultimaker originals with custom upgrades (doesn't work)
    - NotBot
    - BoxBot
    - YarrBot (doesn't work, getting thrown?)
- 1 Series 1 Pro 3001 (works?)
    - Bigbot
- 1 ANYCUBIC (works?)
- 1 Original Prusa (*works*)
- 1 printbot plus
- 1 Vertex, welleman (doesn't work, getting thrown?)
- 1 Home made printer called Blackbot
- 1 Small home made printer

## The online information is outdated
bitraf has some [information](https://bitraf.no/wiki/3D_printer) regarding its 3D printers

- [Ultimaker Original](https://bitraf.no/wiki/Ultimaker_Original) 
- [Bigbot](https://bitraf.no/wiki/Bigbot_Instruksjoner) 
- [Blackbot](https://bitraf.no/wiki/Blackbot_Instruksjoner)


At the moment, only bigbot (which is the 3rd biggest printer in the room) is working.

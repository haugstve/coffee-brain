# 3D printers at bitraf

## There are 10 3D printers
Most of these doesn't work at the moment. Plants to upgrade and fix seems limited. This means there might be ample opportunity to get stuff done using only initiative. However, this increases the amount of work significantly. 

The 10 printers are:
- 3 Ultimaker originals with custom upgrades (doesn't work)
    - NotBot
    - BoxBot
    - YarrBot (doesn't work, getting thrown?)
- 1 Series 1 Pro 3001 (works?)
    - Bigbot
- 1 ANYCUBIC (works?)
- 1 Original Prusa (*works*)
- 1 printbot plus
- 1 Vertex, welleman (doesn't work, getting thrown?)
- 1 Home made printer called Blackbot
- 1 Small home made printer

## The online information is outdated
bitraf has some [information](https://bitraf.no/wiki/3D_printer) regarding its 3D printers

- [Ultimaker Original](https://bitraf.no/wiki/Ultimaker_Original) 
- [Bigbot](https://bitraf.no/wiki/Bigbot_Instruksjoner) 
- [Blackbot](https://bitraf.no/wiki/Blackbot_Instruksjoner)


At the moment, only bigbot (which is the 3rd biggest printer in the room) is working.

## Testing of Bigbot
- This uses octoprint which is a online interface for printing
- Cura marketplace has a plugin that allows you to connect to octoprint
- It seems it is intentionally hard to get to work at bitraf
- Uploading the stl files directly to the octoprint server and doing the slicing there seems to be the easiest way
- For å gjøre det er det bare å logge på bitraf nettet og 
gå til http://bigbot.local
- Første print var av shouldershell.stl, det feilet 
- Konklusjon, platen under er for slitt til at bifgbot kan brukes

## Testing of ANYCUBIC
- Klarte ikke å bytte filament på denne
- Det ligger en lapp som sier 

## Testing av Orinal Prusa

## Testing of printbot plus
